What is EventMovement?

EventMovement is a new and exciting way to create and commission training events and courses at Newcastle University Library. Start with an idea for an event, involve the community and make it happen!

Each idea goes through three simple steps:

1.	Start an Idea
Start an idea for a course with just a few clicks. Share it with your friends to get support for your idea.

2.	Get Involved
Work with other students to develop and shape the idea. Vote to have your voice heard and join in with the discussion.

3.	Make it Happen
The library will respond to your idea with a plan for the course. Show the plan your support, or make your own plan for what the final course should be.
