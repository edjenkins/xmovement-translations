What is EventMovement?

EventMovement is a new and exciting way to create and commission training events and events at Newcastle University Sunderland Software City. Start with an idea for an event, involve the community and make it happen!

Each idea goes through three simple steps:

1.	Start an Idea
Start an idea for a event with just a few clicks. Share it with your friends to get support for your idea.

2.	Design
Work with other students to develop and shape the idea. Vote to have your voice heard and join in with the discussion.

3.	Make it Happen
The Sunderland Software City will respond to your idea with a Offer for the event. Show the Offer your support, or make your own Offer for what the final event should be.
